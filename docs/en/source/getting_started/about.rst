Welcome to the `open_AR_Sandbox <https://github.com/cgre-aachen/open_AR_Sandbox>`_ repository. If you do not know what
this is all about, have a look at this video:

⚠️Warning! It is unfortunate that we have to state this here, but:

Downloading the software and presenting it somewhere as your own work is serious scientific fraud! And if you develop
content further, then please push these developments back to this repostory - in the very interest of scientific
development (and also a requirement of the license). For more details, please consult the information below and the

Augmented Reality (AR) Sandboxes are a great tool for science outreach and teaching due to their intuitive and
interaction-enhancing operation. Recently AR Sandboxes are becoming increasingly popular as interactive exhibition
pieces, teaching aids and toys.

AR Sandboxes consist of a box of sand that can be freely sculpted by hand. The topography of the sand is constantly
scanned with a depth camera and a computed image is projected back onto the sand surface, augmenting the sandbox with
digital information.

However, most of these common AR Sandboxes are limited to the visualization of topography with contour lines and colors,
as well as water simulations on the digital terrain surface. The potential for AR Sandboxes for geoscience education,
and especially for teaching structural geology, remains largely untapped.

For this reason, we have developed `open_AR_Sandbox <https://github.com/cgre-aachen/open_AR_Sandbox>`_, an augmented
reality sandbox designed specifically for the use in geoscience education. In addition to the visualization of
topography it can display geologic subsurface information such as the outcropping lithology, creating a dynamic and
interactive geological map. The relations of subsurface structures, topography and outcrop can be explored in a playful
and comprehensible way.
