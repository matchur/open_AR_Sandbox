   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Requirements
============

You will need:

- Microsoft Kinect (we tested the first and second generation kinect with a usb adapter, but every kinect compatible
  with the pyKinect drivers will likely work).
- Projector
- A box of Sand

Mount the Kinect and projector facing down vertically in the center above of the box. The optimal distance will depend
on the size of your sandbox and the optics of the projector, from our experience a distance of 150 cm is well suited
for a 80 cm x 100 cm box. More details on how to set up the Kinect and projector can be found in the
1_calib_projector.ipynb and 2_calib_sensor.ipynb notebooks, and if you want to use the ArUco markers
3_calib_arucos.ipynb.
